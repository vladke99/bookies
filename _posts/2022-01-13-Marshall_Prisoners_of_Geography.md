couverture: In the bestselling tradition of Why Nations Fail and The Revenge of Geography, an award-winning journalist uses ten maps of crucial regions to explain the geo-political strategies of the world powers.All leaders of nations are constrained by geography. Their choices are limited by mountains, rivers, seas, and concrete. To understand world events, news organizations and other authorities often focus on people, ideas, and political movements, but without geography, we never have the full picture. Now, in the relevant and timely Prisoners of Geography, seasoned journalist Tim Marshall examines Russia, China, the USA, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Japan and Korea, and Greenland and the Arctic—their weather, seas, mountains, rivers, deserts, and borders—to provide a context often missing from our political reportage; how the physical characteristics of these countries affect their strengths and vulnerabilities and the decisions made by their leaders.In ten, up-to-date maps of each region, Marshall explains in clear and engaging prose the complex geo-political strategies of these key parts of the globe. What does it mean that Russia must have a navy, but also has frozen ports six months a year? How does this affect Putin’s treatment of Ukraine? How is China’s future constrained by its geography? Why will Europe never be united? Why will America never be invaded? Shining a light on the unavoidable physical realities that shape all of our aspirations and endeavors, Prisoners of Geography is the critical guide to one of the major (and most often overlooked) determining factors in world history.
summ: <div><h3>Key Idea 1; Russia is an aggressive presence in the Baltics because it fears invasion from the West.</h3><div><p>There&rsquo;s no denying the fact that Russia is enormous. Covering a sprawling 6 million square miles and containing eleven different time zones, Russia is by far the world&rsquo;s biggest country.</p><p>So what keeps Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, tossing and turning at night? It&rsquo;s one particular stretch of land that somewhat resembles a slice of pizza.</p><p>Beginning in Poland, this particular pizza-slice-shaped wedge extends southeast to the foot of the Ural Mountain range, and northeast to Russia&rsquo;s capital city of Moscow.</p><p>What keeps Putin particularly worried is that this area of land is part of what&rsquo;s called the&nbsp;<em>North European Plain</em>, which stretches from France across Belgium, the Netherlands, Northern Germany, Poland and ends at the Russian Urals. As the name suggests, this area is flat and makes the European gateway to Russia vulnerable and difficult to defend.</p><p>Any country within the North European Plain could conceivably send an army across the flatlands and directly into Moscow. As Putin knows all too well, this is exactly what has happened to Russia throughout its history.</p><p>During both world wars, this is the path the Germans took in their military campaigns. But that&rsquo;s not all &ndash; since 1812, invaders from the Northern European Plain have attacked Russia an average of once every 33 years!</p><p>For generations now, Russia&rsquo;s strategy for neutralizing the threat from the North European Plain has been to control Poland and all the Baltic states that lie between it and Russia, which include Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Belarus.</p><p>These are the nations that make up the meat of that pizza slice, so to speak. While the wedge stretches 2,000 miles from north to south at its easternmost section, it&rsquo;s only 300 miles wide around Poland and the Baltic states. If Russia can station a strong defensive front here, it can more easily hold off potential Western invaders.</p><p>Unfortunately, this means the Baltic states are likely to continue having a rough go of it.</p></div></div><div><h3>Key Idea 2; China&rsquo;s fears of Indian invasion and water shortages keep their grip on Tibet strong.</h3><div><p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with the history of Tibet, you know it&rsquo;s been the site of an ongoing struggle for freedom from Chinese rule. It&rsquo;s also one that has involved regular, though always shocking, acts of Tibetan monks setting themselves on fire to protest Chinese oppression. In 2008, 21 Tibetans died after protests turned especially violent.</p><p>There&rsquo;s been no shortage of humanitarian pleas calling for an end to the occupation of Tibet. So why does China refuse to let go of Tibet?</p><p>The answer to this question lies just west of Tibet; India.</p><p>China and India are far and away the two most populous countries on the planet, so there&rsquo;s tension over how ugly any major conflict between them could become. It is perhaps fortunate that there is a natural buffer zone between these two world powers in the form of the Himalayan mountains, which run along the western border of China. But this is unfortunate for Tibet, since it&rsquo;s smack dab in the middle of this buffer zone.</p><p>Tibet&rsquo;s homeland is the Tibetan Plateau, which is right next to the Himalayas, on China&rsquo;s side of the divide. So, in the theoretical event of India sending an invading army over the Himalayas, they could occupy the Tibetan plateau and have a commanding position, looking down upon mainland China, from which they could launch their attack.</p><p>This is China&rsquo;s primary strategic reason for occupying Tibet. If they don&rsquo;t control it, they&rsquo;re leaving the door open for India to take it and thereby leaving themselves extremely vulnerable.</p><p>However, there is another motive behind China&rsquo;s actions; water.</p><p>Tibet has long held the nickname &ldquo;China&rsquo;s water tower,&rdquo; since three of China&rsquo;s main rivers &ndash; the Mekong, the Yellow River and the Yangtze &ndash; all have their sources in Tibet. So, not only would India have a superior offensive position in Tibet, if they occupied this area they could also cut off China&rsquo;s main water supply.</p><p>As far as China is concerned, whether or not India would ever&nbsp;<em>want</em>&nbsp;to deprive China of water is irrelevant. The fact is that they&nbsp;<em>could</em>, and this is enough of a threat to China&rsquo;s prosperity for them to continue occupying Tibet.</p></div></div><div><h3>Key Idea 3; Guns and geographical good fortune make the United States invulnerable.</h3><div><p>If you were to think of the world in terms of real estate, which country do you think a realtor would hold in the highest regard? If you factor in things like good neighbors, water supplies and state-of-the-art security features, most real estate agents would put the United States of America on the top of their list.</p><p>Unlike most of the countries mentioned in these book summary, the United States has few concerns about traditional invasions.</p><p>The geographical position of the United States is unique in that it makes the country practically invulnerable to any invading army. Its only neighbors are Canada and Mexico, and they&rsquo;re not just friendly, they&rsquo;re also big enough that any invading army attempting to reach the United States by going through these countries would have to establish impossibly long supply lines.</p><p>Perhaps the best protection the United States has working in its favor are the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which border the country&rsquo;s west and east coasts, respectively. This effectively cuts off the east and the west from attacks, since any invading force would have to contend with an entire, volatile ocean before even reaching its target.</p><p>As for the state-of-the-art security system &ndash; well, how does 100,000,000 loaded guns sound?</p><p>The United States&rsquo; lenient gun laws have resulted in every small town having the potential to take up arms and immediately defend itself from invasion without any help from the federal government. This is a country with the right to bear arms written into its social fabric, so guns are within easy reach for millions of Americans.</p><p>Any invading force would have a new set of armed civilians in every Springfield and Sunnydale they come across.</p></div></div><div><h3>Key Idea 4; Geography has blessed northern Europe and blighted its south.</h3><div><p>Thanks to the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution, Europe has hugely contributed to the modern world, for better or for worse. This isn&rsquo;t just happenstance; it&rsquo;s due in large part to Europe&rsquo;s temperate climate, generous rainfall and fertile soil, all of which helped build thriving societies.</p><p>Due to geography, however, some areas of Europe have thrived more than others.</p><p>In 2012, when the Eurozone crisis was at its peak, nasty stereotypes began appearing in German media with increasing frequency, in attempts to explain why some regions of Europe were experiencing such a severe economic downturn.</p><p>In particular, these generalizations portrayed northern Europeans as industrious hard workers, and southern Europeans as a bunch of lazy slackers. But rather than being attributable to work ethic, the true reason for the struggles of some southern European countries lies in geography.</p><p>The same Northern European Plain that haunts Russia has provided France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands with fertile soil and a wealth of productive crops. As a result, they&rsquo;re the nations associated with hard work and money. And with a surplus of crops and goods to trade, northern Europe became home to bustling cities of commerce and major urban hubs.</p><p>In contrast, countries in southern Europe have far less arable land.</p><p>Greece, for example, doesn&rsquo;t have enough fertile land to be a major agricultural exporter, and this also means that the country can only develop a small handful of those major cities of commerce that are so abundant in the north. It's in these cities, like London and Hamburg, where you&rsquo;ll find the highly educated and skilled workers that drive forward modern economies.</p><p>Unfortunately for southern European nations like Greece, geography still plays a major factor in its well-being and political future.</p></div></div><div><h3>Key Idea 5; Geography has given Africa beautiful but impractical waterways.</h3><div><p>The relationship Africa has with its oceans and waterways is a complex and frustrating one, and this isn&rsquo;t just as a result of its vast deserts. Africa is home to some of the world&rsquo;s most stunning beaches and coastlines, as well as legendary rivers. But as we&rsquo;ll see, African countries have been dealt a difficult hand when it comes to being able to use these waterways for commercial gain.</p><p>For starters, Africa&rsquo;s picture-perfect coastline is all but useless when it comes to setting up harbors.</p><p>Unlike much of the jagged coastlines found along Europe and the United States, where the ocean sharply declines into deep waters that are perfect for docking boats, Africa&rsquo;s shoreline is mostly smooth and shallow. This makes it impossible for cargo ships to load and unload goods for importing and exporting.</p><p>While this remains a problem, human ingenuity is starting to find a way around Africa&rsquo;s problematic geography. Tanzania and Angola, for instance, have formed partnerships with China to start creating man-made deepwater harbors. In Tanzania, they&rsquo;re using sheer brute force to expand the port of Bagamoyo so that it will eventually be able to load and unload 20 million containers of cargo each year, making it Africa&rsquo;s biggest port.</p><p>But Africa&rsquo;s challenges don&rsquo;t end with the coastline. Moving inland, it&rsquo;s Africa&rsquo;s rivers that pose another geographical obstacle that has hindered trade.</p><p>The Zambezi River is one of the continent&rsquo;s longest and most spectacular rivers. Its 1,600-mile waterway runs through six countries and is punctuated with whitewater rapids and breathtaking waterfalls, such as Victoria Falls. These stunning features may be great for adventurers, but they severely limit the river&rsquo;s usefulness for transportation. Simply put, cargo ships and waterfalls don&rsquo;t mix.</p><p>The impracticality of Africa&rsquo;s rivers as useful trade routes has made both trade and contact between the continent&rsquo;s different regions very limited. This has, in turn, significantly hindered economic development across the continent and prevented major trade routes from forming.</p></div></div><div><h3>Key Idea 6; Geography has gifted North Korea with hills, while there&rsquo;s flat land in South Korea all the way to Seoul.</h3><div><p>With the seemingly endless threats, it poses to neighboring countries, North Korea is becoming a major headache &ndash; especially for South Korea. You may be wondering how this difficult arrangement has lasted so long and, once again, the answer lies in geography.</p><p>Even though South Korea has twice the population and 80 times the economic power of North Korea, not to mention having a superpower like the United States on its side, South Korea has remained the vulnerable one.</p><p>This is because of the hills and elevated terrain located along North Korea&rsquo;s side of the border, which is located only 35 miles away from Seoul, South Korea&rsquo;s capital city, where half of the country&rsquo;s 50 million citizens live.</p><p>Within these hills, military experts estimate that North Korea has 10,000 weapons stashed, ready to fire 500,000 rounds into the city of Seoul within 60 minutes. So, if a conflict were to occur, South Korea knows that it would have to immediately contend with millions of civilians fleeing south from Seoul, while at the same time trying to create a strong defensive line in that area. It doesn&rsquo;t take a strategic genius to recognize that this is a recipe for chaos.</p><p>Another geographic feature working against South Korea is that the 35 miles of land separating Seoul from North Korea are flat, making the hills along the North Korean side of the border even more dangerous.</p><p>Therefore, if North Korea were to launch a surprise attack, their army could move quite easily over the flat terrain and into the heart of the enemy&rsquo;s capital city, landing a devastating blow. On the other hand, if South Korea were to launch a surprise attack, it would immediately hit a series of geographical speed bumps that would slow down ground troops and make them vulnerable to attack.</p><p>This is partly why these two opposing nations have remained in a political deadlock for over 50 years.</p></div></div>

<p>By 1500 BCE in this heartland, out of hundreds of mini city-states, many warring with each other, emerged the earliest version of a Chinese state – the Shang dynasty. This is where what became known as the Han people emerged, protecting the heartland and creating a buffer zone around them. The Han now make up over 90 per cent of China’s population and they dominate Chinese politics and business.</p>

<p>It remains a feature of China to this day that when China opens up, the coastland regions prosper but the inland areas are neglected. The prosperity engendered by trade has made coastal cities such as Shanghai wealthy, but that wealth has not been reaching the countryside. This has added to the massive influx of people into urban areas and accentuated regional differences.</p>

<p>Vietnam is an irritation for China. For centuries the two have squabbled over territory, and unfortunately for both this is the one area to the south which has a border an army can get across without too much trouble – which partially explains the 1,000-year domination and occupation of Vietnam by China from 111 BCE to 938 CE and their brief cross-border war of 1979. However, as China’s military prowess grows, Vietnam will be less inclined to get drawn into a shooting match and will either cosy up even closer to the Americans for protection or quietly begin shifting diplomatically to become friends with Beijing. </p>

<p>There are similar reasons for the Party’s resistance to democracy and individual rights. If the population were to be given a free vote, the unity of the Han might begin to crack or, more likely, the countryside and urban areas would come into conflict. That in turn would embolden the people of the buffer zones, further weakening China. It is only a century since the most recent humiliation of the rape of China by foreign powers; for Beijing, unity and economic progress are priorities well ahead of democratic principles.</p>

<p>The Appalachians, 1,500 miles long, are impressive, but compared to the Rockies, not particularly high. Nevertheless, they still formed a formidable barrier to westward movement for the early settlers, who were busy consolidating what territory they had subdued and preparing to govern it themselves. The colonists had another barrier, this one political. The British government forbade settlement west of the Appalachians as it wanted to ensure that trade, and taxes, remained on the Eastern seaboard.</p>

<p>At the stroke of a pen, and the handing over of $15 million, the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 doubled the size of the USA and gave it mastery over the greatest inland water transport route in the world. As the American historian Henry Adams wrote, ‘Never did the United States get so much for so little.’ The greater Mississippi basin has more miles of navigable river than the rest of the world put together. Nowhere else are there so many rivers whose source is not in high land, and whose waters run smoothly all the way to the ocean across vast distances. </p>

<p>Europe’s location. The climate, fed by the Gulf Stream, blessed the region with the right amount of rainfall to cultivate crops on a large scale, and the right type of soil for them to flourish in. This allowed for population growth in an area in which, for most, work was possible all year round, even in the heights of summer. Winter actually adds a bonus, with temperatures warm enough to work in but cold enough to kill off many of the germs which to this day plague huge parts of the rest of the world. Good harvests mean surplus food that can be traded; this in turn builds up trading centres which become towns. It also allows people to think of more than just growing food and turn their attention to ideas and technology. Western Europe has no real deserts, the frozen wastes are confined to a few areas in the far north, and earthquakes, volcanoes and massive flooding are rare. The rivers are long, flat, navigable and made for trade. As they empty into a variety of seas and oceans they flow into coastlines which are, west, north and south, abundant in natural harbours.</p>

<p>Of all the countries in the plain, France was best situated to take advantage of it. France is the only European country to be both a northern and southern power. It contains the largest expanse of fertile land in Western Europe, and many of its rivers connect with each other; one flows west all the way to the Atlantic (the Seine), another south to the Mediterranean (the Rhône). These factors, together with its relative flatness, lent themselves to unification of regions, and – especially from the time of Napoleon – centralisation of power.</p>

<p>The mainland is protected by mountains, but there are about 1,400 Greek islands (6,000 if you include various rocks sticking out of the Aegean) of which about 200 are inhabited. It takes a decent navy just to patrol this territory, never mind one strong enough to deter any attempt to take them over. The result is a huge cost in military spending that Greece cannot afford. During the Cold War the Americans, and to a lesser extent the British, were content to underwrite some of the military requirements in order to keep the Soviet Union out of the Aegean and the Mediterranean. When the Cold War ended, so did the cheques. But Greece kept spending.</p>

It was one thing to have US forces on the peninsula, quite another when they were north of the parallel – indeed north of the mountains above Hamhung – and within striking distance of China itself. Chinese troops poured across the Yalu and thirty-six months of fierce fighting ensued with massive casualties on all sides before they ground to a halt along the current border and agreed a truce, but not a treaty.

<p>Japan had few of the natural resources required to become an industrialised nation. It had limited and poor-quality supplies of coal, very little oil, scant quantities of natural gas, limited supplies of rubber and a shortage of many metals. This is as true now as it was 100 years ago, although offshore gas fields are being explored along with undersea deposits of precious metals. Nevertheless it remains the world’s largest importer of natural gas, and third-largest importer of oil. It was the thirst for these products that caused Japan to rampage across China in the 1930s and then South-East Asia in the early 1940s. It had already occupied Taiwan in 1895 and followed this up with the annexation of Korea in 1910. Japan occupied Manchuria in 1932, then conducted a full-scale invasion of China in 1937. As each domino fell, the expanding empire and the growing Japanese population required more oil, more coal, more metal, more rubber and more food.</p>

However it wasn’t until the early 1990s that Washington took the war directly to the Colombian drug cartels with overt assistance to the Colombian government. It also had success in closing down many of the air and sea drug routes from Colombia into the USA. The cartels responded by creating a land route – up through Central America and Mexico, and into the American Southwest. This in turn led the Mexican drug gangs to get in on the action by facilitating the routes and manufacturing their own produce. The multibillion-dollar business sparked local turf wars, with the winners using their new power and money to infiltrate and corrupt the Mexican police and military and get inside the political and business elites.</p>

<p>Without drugs the country would be even poorer than it is, as a vast amount of foreign money would be cut off. With drugs, it is even more violent than it would otherwise be. The same is true of some of the countries to Mexico’s south.</p>

<p>However, Argentina has not always used its advantages to the full. A hundred years ago it was among the ten richest countries in the world – ahead of France and Italy. But a failure to diversify, a stratified and unfair society, a poor education system, a succession of coups d’état and the wildly differing economic policies in the democratic period of the last thirty years have seen a sharp decline in Argentina’s status.</p>

<p>All the sovereignty issues stem from the same desires and fears – the desire to safeguard routes for military and commercial shipping, the desire to own the natural riches of the region, and the fear that others may gain where you lose. Until recently the riches were theoretical, but the melting ice has made the theoretical probable, and in some cases certain.</p>

<p>This race has rules, a formula and a forum for decision-making. The Arctic Council is composed of mature countries, most of them democratic to a greater or lesser degree. The international laws regulating territorial disputes, environmental pollution, laws of the sea and treatment of minority peoples are in place. Most of the territory in dispute has not been conquered through nineteenth-century imperialism or by nation states at war with each other.</p>
