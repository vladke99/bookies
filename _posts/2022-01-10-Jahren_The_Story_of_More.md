couverture: From the bestselling author of Lab Girl comes a slim, urgent missive on the defining issue of our time; here is Hope Jahren on climate change, our timeless pursuit of more, and how the same human ambition that got us here can also be our salvation. A Vintage Original.Hope Jahren is an award-winning geobiologist, a brilliant writer, and one of the seven billion people with whom we share this earth. The Story of More is her impassioned open letter to humanity as we stand at the crossroads of survival and extinction. Jahren celebrates the long history of our enterprising spirit--which has tamed wild crops, cured diseases, and sent us to the moon--but also shows how that spirit has created excesses that are quickly warming our planet to dangerous levels. In short, highly readable chapters, she takes us through the science behind the key inventions--from electric power to large-scale farming and automobiles--that, even as they help us, release untenable amounts of carbon dioxide. She explains the current and projected consequences of greenhouse gases--from superstorms to rising sea levels--and the science-based tools that could help us fight back. At once an explainer on the mechanisms of warming and a capsule history of human development, The Story of More illuminates the link between our consumption habits and our endangered earth, showing us how we can use less and share more. It is the essential pocket primer on climate change that will leave an indelible impact on everyone who reads it.
summ: Chapter 1 provides a brief background of Jahren’s life and what prompted her to write this book. Namely, she began teaching college students about climate change in 2009. Her research for that course led her to understand the catastrophic trend of overconsumption that has become a hallmark of our global population in the last 50 years.<br><br><br><br>In Chapter 2, Jahren examines global population growth from ancient times into the modern day. In 2020, the Earth hosted over seven billion people, a number that would have shocked our ancestors. Having enough resources for those billions of people is a significant challenge.<br><br><br><br>Chapter 3 explores the primary causes of human death across the world. Disease is the number one killer of all humans, but we do not necessarily die of the same types of diseases. People in wealthier regions more often perish from stroke, heart attack, or cancer, while people in poorer regions die at younger ages from communicable diseases.<br><br><br><br>Chapter 4 introduces the “OECD,” or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD comprises the regions of the world that contain the wealthiest countries, including North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. People living in these regions consume most of the Earth’s resources and produce most of its waste.<br><br><br><br>Chapter 5 turns to the topic of food. Since the mid-20th century, farmers and scientists have made great strides in improving agricultural yields, particularly in the development of monocrop farms that produce three times the amount of corn, wheat, or soybeans previously possible.<br><br><br><br>In Chapter 6, Jahren examines the astounding quantity of meat that people living in OECD countries consume. Americans, in particular, eat far too much meat. Similar to the agricultural industry, scientists have learned how to increase the yield of animals for slaughter by feeding them more, keeping them alive longer, and processing them faster.<br><br><br><br>Chapter 7 investigates aquaculture, or the industry that raises and processes fish on a mass scale. Similar to grain and meat production, yields in aquaculture have tripled in the last decades as fish consumption has skyrocketed across nations.<br><br><br><br>Chapter 8 evaluates the presence of added sugar in the majority of Americans’ packaged foods. Sugar derives from multiple crops, including sugar cane or beets, but in modern-day America a majority of it comes from corn and is called high fructose corn syrup (HFCS).<br><br><br><br>Chapter 9 examines the significant amount of trash and sewage that countries in the OECD produce. OECD countries generate 30% of the globe’s food waste but constitute just 15% of the population.<br><br><br><br>In Chapter 10, Jahren discusses the amount of energy countries in the OECD consume. We are so used to the presence of electricity that we take it for granted, forgetting that on a minute-by-minute basis we rely on electricity to assist with almost every task.<br><br><br><br>Chapter 11 provides a brief overview of the major forms of travel popular in OECD countries, including planes, cars, and trains. Planes use a significant amount of fossil fuels—an upsetting realization when we consider that people are flying more than ever. Cars, likewise, consume a great deal of fossil fuels and have proved an incredibly dangerous form of transportation.<br><br><br><br>Chapter 12 turns to fossil fuels, which are the remains of decomposed plant and animal life that have, over millions of years, transformed into products such as oil and coal. Globally, we rely on fossil fuels to power the majority of our energy needs, and yet these nonrenewable resources are in very short supply.<br><br><br><br>In Chapter 13, Jahren discusses other forms of renewable energy sources, including wind-driven turbines, water-driven turbines, and solar panels.<br><br><br><br>Chapter 14 discusses carbon dioxide, a type of gas released into the atmosphere during the process of turning fossil fuels into energy. Carbon dioxide is warming the atmosphere at an alarming rate.<br><br><br><br>Chapter 15 tracks the process of how a warming atmosphere is changing global weather patterns. It introduces the term “global weirding” to describe the erratic results of too much carbon dioxide in the sky.<br><br><br><br>In Chapter 16, Jahren briefly summarizes the types and extent of ice present in the Arctic and Antarctic, including glaciers, sea ice, and ice sheets. Warming temperatures in both the atmosphere and ocean are causing the polar ice caps to melt.<br><br><br><br>Chapter 17 discusses sea level rise, which is the result of melting polar ice and sea water expanding as it warms. This affects some coastal regions more than others.<br><br><br><br>Chapter 18 turns to the topic of extinction. While it is normal for all species to go extinct at some point, climate change and habitat loss may be causing a sixth mass extinction. By 2050, we may lose around 25% of the current species living on Earth.<br><br><br><br>Chapter 19 concludes with a warning; Engineering solutions will not fix climate change. Instead, we all need to live by Jahren’s motto; “Use Less and Share More.”<br><br><br><br>In the Appendix, Jahren offers some step-by-step solutions to addressing climate change, which mainly focus on changing our personal spending, eating, traveling, and investment habits.<br>

Soybeans, barley, oats, rye, and millet all show dramatic increases as well. Not only that, but coffee, tobacco, and sugar-beet yields have increased by more than 50 percent—in fact, every single field crop that I researched for this book showed a substantial increase in yield over the last half century.</p>

<p>Humanity has been in this exact jam before, back in 1950 when it became clear that the global population would eventually exceed four billion, and we wriggled out of it by vastly increasing yields. Now we find ourselves staring down the barrel of a long century having already played that ace. Science fiction notwithstanding, there is only so much corn that can be hung from a stalk and only so much meat that can be balanced on a backbone—we are running up against the biological limits of what our food can be. Sooner or later we will have to reconsider the fact that every year, we actively waste 90 percent of the grain we feed to animals, in exchange for a little meat and a lot of manure.</p>

<p>Thus 1990 marked a major shift in fishing all around the globe, not just in Norway. Between 1990 and today, global seafood production has doubled, but the amount of fish pulled from the ocean has not changed. More than half of the fish eaten worldwide is now produced through aquaculture. This forms an important contribution to the spectacular increase in our ability to produce food during the last fifty years:</p>

<p>To get one pound of salmon, you need three pounds of fish meal. To get a pound of fish meal, you need to grind up five pounds of fish. Thus, each pound of cage-raised salmon “costs” fifteen pounds of fish from the ocean. At present, about one-third of the total catch fished out of the ocean is ground up into fish meal and then fed to fish that live in pens. Anchovies, herring, and sardines are the most fished fish in the world, and almost all of the catch is used as fish meal for aquaculture. These small fish are also foragers, which means that they survive on plankton—the tiniest plants and animals of the ocean. Foragers are near the base of the ocean’s food web, where they serve as a staple food source for more charismatic species, including dolphins, sea lions, and humpback whales. More small fish diverted into aquaculture to feed us means less food left in the ocean to feed them.</p>

<p>More than nine million tons of the annual seaweed haul—that’s almost half of the world’s production—is not eaten by people. Part of it is dried, ground, and used as fertilizer for crops on land, another portion is used in feed for animals, and the remainder is processed into chemical additives for a dizzying array of products, including cosmetics, moisturizers, shampoos, toothpastes, lubricants, inks, and bandages. The other half is eaten by people, but not in any form that they would recognize as seaweed. Seaweed is used to produce “hydrocolloids”: very large molecules that dissolve in water to make a viscous solution. There are three main types: alginate, agar, and carrageenan; all are low-calorie carbohydrates that can be used to thicken almost any solution. Today, more often than not, when we purchase ice cream, whipped cream, and salad dressing, they were made using recipes that rely upon extracts of soy and seaweed to approximate the properties we associate with milk, eggs, and cream. Seaweed extracts never become rancid the way milk- and egg-derived thickeners do, so they have been widely adopted to both thicken and stabilize foods that previously relied on animal products prone to spoilage, such as frosting, cream fillings, jelly, and jam. Alginate, agar, and carrageenan, all made from seaweed, represent three from about twenty new chemicals that have quietly revolutionized the entire concept of food during the last fifty years, in a way that has done us no good at all.</p>

<p>The story of aquaculture is simply that of meat production, only underwater. As such, it echoes the story of meat production on land: the diversion of massive resources through a small space confining millions of animals who live short lives that end in our bellies. And, as with meat, every bite of fish that we do not take could free up many bites of food for someone else.</p>

<p>About 10 percent (by mass) of the food that you eat exits your body as solid waste. It has been thoroughly transformed, of course, and contains a large number of bacteria that did you a huge favor by helping you to digest what you ate. Living well requires a massive population of these bacteria in your gut, but you’ll get very sick if even a small population gets near your mouth. The average adult produces about two pounds of feces and four gallons of urine each week, and all of it must be transported far away from the point of production and rendered innocuous more or less immediately.</p>

America’s bridges, railroads, sewers—they’re not in good shape, and we’re starting to see them fail outright. Old cities such as Philadelphia have it the worst: three thousand miles of sewer lines, with construction started in 1883 and completed in 1966 and since then minor upgrades only. It’s true that the total population of Philadelphia hasn’t changed much since 1980, but on average, Americans eat 15 percent more food each day, which translates into 15 percent more…well, you get my drift.</p>

<p>Our ability to deal with this waste has not kept up, and today, a larger number of people than ever before live within conditions of inadequate sanitation. At present, more than two billion people on planet Earth have no access to any system that would remove and sanitize the human excrement produced where they live. Similarly, about one billion people live without access to drinking water that has been fully purified of sewage. This forms an important part of what we’ll see more clearly in chapter 10: that a large fraction of the world has yet to share in even the most rudimentary benefits conferred during our decades-long global pursuit of more.</p>

<p>I am honestly unsure whether to feel more depressed or hopeful about it, but the magnitude of our global waste is in many ways equal to our need. The amount of total grain that is wasted is close to the annual food supply of grain available in India. The amount of fruits and vegetables that is wasted each year exceeds the annual food supply of fruits and vegetables for the entire continent of Africa.

<p>Oil is mostly burned in the combustion engines of automobiles, coal is mostly burned in order to generate electricity within power plants, and natural gas is mostly burned in the furnaces that power factories. Burning fossil fuel is not the only way to power an engine and to generate electricity and heat, but it is far and away the most common method in use today. Almost 90 percent of the energy used on Earth—to drive, to cook, to light, to warm, to cool, to manufacture—comes from the burning of fossil fuels. The world’s reliance on oil versus coal versus natural gas is split pretty evenly: of all the fossil fuels burned each year, 40 percent is oil, 30 percent is coal, and another 30 percent is natural gas.</p>

Today, 20 percent of the grain grown on planet Earth is converted to biofuel—that’s a huge fraction for a planet that is also home to eight hundred million starving people, though biofuel enthusiasts are quick to point out that the raw material for biofuel production can and sometimes does include both edible and inedible portions of the plant.</p>

<p>At present, global production of plastic is more than three hundred million metric tons per year; all put together, that’s about equal to the total weight of all persons on Earth. Today’s total plastic production is ten times larger than it was in 1969, which had grown quickly up from zero starting in about 1940. Fortunately or unfortunately, the majority of plastic produced each year is consumed as disposable packaging. On average, a person living within the OECD discards just over his or her body weight in plastic every single year, and despite burgeoning efforts to recycle, more than 90 percent of it is simply dumped into the landfill.

Earth’s most recent mass extinction occurred about sixty-six million years ago and resulted in the disappearance of the dinosaurs.

<p>Equally fanciful is the notion of drawing down carbon dioxide by enhancing rock weathering: every year, a small amount of carbon dioxide naturally leaves the atmosphere to mix with rainwater. This yields a weak acid that trickles down into the soil and dissolves the bedrock at its base. Scientists have proposed to increase the amount of rock surface-area available for weathering by grinding up volcanic minerals and then dusting the debris across the tropical forests and farm fields of India, Brazil, and Southeast Asia. As with carbon capture and storage, however, the energy used in grinding, transporting, and spraying millions of tons of rock dust would outbalance any gains that were made in carbon dioxide reduction, at least for several centuries.</p>

<p>More promising is the idea of fertilizing plant growth on the ocean’s surface: there are vast areas of the Pacific Ocean that lack only one or two key nutrients and could be stimulated to yield huge colonies of green algae and phytoplankton within weeks—tiny plants that would eventually die and sink to the bottom of the ocean, effectively trapping the carbon dioxide that they used to form their tissues. Seeding tropical waters with iron or phosphorus could trigger such blooms, but the exact amount of carbon dioxide that could be trapped is uncertain, as are the consequences for ocean life, including the fish that we depend upon as a food source.</p>

<p>One popular solution is to stimulate plant growth, to naturally pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and transform it into living tissue. This is what trees do by growing on land, and it is what algae do by growing in the ocean. Multiple schemes offer people an offset of the carbon dioxide produced when they fly by paying money for trees to be planted. This is an appealing concept—after all, who doesn’t like the idea of more forest?—but the numbers are not as favorable as you might think. First of all, the rewards are slow to kick in, as most seedlings take decades to grow into a respectable tree. Furthermore, trees don’t permanently incorporate much carbon dioxide into their tissues, as most of the leaves and needles that fall to the ground each year shrivel up and decay, releasing carbon dioxide right back up into the atmosphere. The most stable stash of fixed carbon dioxide in the forest is the tiny percentage of rotted plant material that makes it into the soil, and new soil takes hundreds to thousands of years to form. Planting trees will offset your energy use, but it won’t pay off during your lifetime and possibly not during your children’s lifetimes, either.</p>

<p>Regarding the crisis in species decline, nothing has been shown to prevent extinctions so well as simply protecting habitats by preventing human access and development. About 13 percent of Earth’s land area is currently under some degree of legal protection, which is more than triple the amount that was protected forty years ago. Ecologists believe that this increase may have reduced extinction rates in mammals, birds, and amphibians by as much as 20 percent, relative to what they would be otherwise. Multiple nations are also considering the establishment of marine protected areas, conserving swaths of ocean from both fishing and shipping transport.</p>

<p>The good news is that there is no reason to think that energy conservation will necessarily reduce our quality of life: life expectancy in Switzerland back in 1965 was similar to that of today’s America and much higher than the current global average. Workdays were shorter, as were commuting distances. Life was not perfect then, but the basics of a healthy life were already in place at a much lower level of fossil fuel use.</p>

<p>if all the fuel and electricity in use today were redistributed equally across the earth’s population, global per capita energy use would be equal to the average consumed in Switzerland during the 1960s. If, instead of waiting for this imaginary redistribution, the countries of North America, Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand reduced their energy use to that level now, total global energy use would plummet by at least 20 percent, as would carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

<p>We, the 20 percent of the globe that uses most of its resources, must begin to detox from this consumption, or things will never get better. Look at your own life: Can you identify the most energy-intensive thing that you do? Are you willing to change? We will never change our institutions if we cannot change ourselves.</p>
