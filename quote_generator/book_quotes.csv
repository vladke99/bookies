Conversely, six of the ten countries with the highest gender gap (that is, those with the most difference between male and female health, opportunity, and participation) fall into the low-income categories. Whether this suggests that wealth gives rise to, or is a product of, female health, opportunity, and participation is not clear; it could be a combination of both.",février 2022,210,Livre,Non-Fiction

Now we find ourselves staring down the barrel of a long century having already played that ace. Science fiction notwithstanding, there is only so much corn that can be hung from a stalk and only so much meat that can be balanced on a backbone—we are running up against the biological limits of what our food can be.

Between 1990 and today, global seafood production has doubled, but the amount of fish pulled from the ocean has not changed.

The Story of More,Hope Jahren,"To get one pound of salmon, you need three pounds of fish meal. To get a pound of fish meal, you need to grind up five pounds of fish. Thus, each pound of cage-raised salmon “costs” fifteen pounds of fish from the ocean. At present, about one-third of the total catch fished out of the ocean is ground up into fish meal and then fed to fish that live in pens. Anchovies, herring, and sardines are the most fished fish in the world, and almost all of the catch is used as fish meal for aquaculture. These small fish are also foragers, which means that they survive on plankton—the tiniest plants and animals of the ocean. Foragers are near the base of the ocean’s food web, where they serve as a staple food source for more charismatic species, including dolphins, sea lions, and humpback whales. More small fish diverted into aquaculture to feed us means less food left in the ocean to feed them.",février 2022,210,Livre,Non-Fiction
The Story of More,Hope Jahren,"More than nine million tons of the annual seaweed haul—that’s almost half of the world’s production—is not eaten by people. Part of it is dried, ground, and used as fertilizer for crops on land, another portion is used in feed for animals, and the remainder is processed into chemical additives for a dizzying array of products, including cosmetics, moisturizers, shampoos, toothpastes, lubricants, inks, and bandages. The other half is eaten by people, but not in any form that they would recognize as seaweed. Seaweed is used to produce “hydrocolloids”: very large molecules that dissolve in water to make a viscous solution. There are three main types: alginate, agar, and carrageenan; all are low-calorie carbohydrates that can be used to thicken almost any solution. Today, more often than not, when we purchase ice cream, whipped cream, and salad dressing, they were made using recipes that rely upon extracts of soy and seaweed to approximate the properties we associate with milk, eggs, and cream. Seaweed extracts never become rancid the way milk- and egg-derived thickeners do, so they have been widely adopted to both thicken and stabilize foods that previously relied on animal products prone to spoilage, such as frosting, cream fillings, jelly, and jam. Alginate, agar, and carrageenan, all made from seaweed, represent three from about twenty new chemicals that have quietly revolutionized the entire concept of food during the last fifty years, in a way that has done us no good at all.",février 2022,210,Livre,Non-Fiction

As such, it echoes the story of meat production on land: the diversion of massive resources through a small space confining millions of animals who live short lives that end in our bellies.

Living well requires a massive population of these bacteria in your gut, but you’ll get very sick if even a small population gets near your mouth.

Old cities such as Philadelphia have it the worst: three thousand miles of sewer lines, with construction started in 1883 and completed in 1966 and since then minor upgrades only.

The number of people who die from the diseases associated with unsanitary conditions is high as a result: 50 percent of people who die each year from communicable diseases such as malaria, cholera, and dysentery die in sub-Saharan Africa.

Thirty years ago, one out of every five people living without clean water and one out of every three people living without a sanitary sewer system lived in India; today, those figures are still the same.

Burning fossil fuel is not the only way to power an engine and to generate electricity and heat, but it is far and away the most common method in use today. Almost 90 percent of the energy used on Earth—to drive, to cook, to light, to warm, to cool, to manufacture—comes from the burning of fossil fuels.

Today, 20 percent of the grain grown on planet Earth is converted to biofuel—that’s a huge fraction for a planet that is also home to eight hundred million starving people, though biofuel enthusiasts are quick to point out that the raw material for biofuel production can and sometimes does include both edible and inedible portions of the plant.",février 2022,210,Livre,Non-Fiction

Fortunately or unfortunately, the majority of plastic produced each year is consumed as disposable packaging. On average, a person living within the OECD discards just over his or her body weight in plastic every single year, and despite burgeoning efforts to recycle, more than 90 percent of it is simply dumped into the landfill.

This yields a weak acid that trickles down into the soil and dissolves the bedrock at its base. Scientists have proposed to increase the amount of rock surface-area available for weathering by grinding up volcanic minerals and then dusting the debris across the tropical forests and farm fields of India, Brazil, and Southeast Asia.

Seeding tropical waters with iron or phosphorus could trigger such blooms, but the exact amount of carbon dioxide that could be trapped is uncertain, as are the consequences for ocean life, including the fish that we depend upon as a food source.",février 2022,210,Livre,Non-Fiction
The Story of More,Hope Jahren,"One popular solution is to stimulate plant growth, to naturally pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and transform it into living tissue. This is what trees do by growing on land, and it is what algae do by growing in the ocean. Multiple schemes offer people an offset of the carbon dioxide produced when they fly by paying money for trees to be planted. This is an appealing concept—after all, who doesn’t like the idea of more forest?—but the numbers are not as favorable as you might think. First of all, the rewards are slow to kick in, as most seedlings take decades to grow into a respectable tree. Furthermore, trees don’t permanently incorporate much carbon dioxide into their tissues, as most of the leaves and needles that fall to the ground each year shrivel up and decay, releasing carbon dioxide right back up into the atmosphere. The most stable stash of fixed carbon dioxide in the forest is the tiny percentage of rotted plant material that makes it into the soil, and new soil takes hundreds to thousands of years to form. Planting trees will offset your energy use, but it won’t pay off during your lifetime and possibly not during your children’s lifetimes, either.",février 2022,210,Livre,Non-Fiction

Knowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won’t make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. As Warren Buffett says, “That’s how knowledge works.

Without good learning habits, you will always feel like you’re behind the curve.

Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations. The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often.

Advertisements are created with a combination of ideal lighting, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits—even the model doesn’t look like the person in the final image.
