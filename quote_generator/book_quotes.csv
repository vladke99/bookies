Le Lion,Joseph Kessel,"Pour bien tuer les bêtes, il faut les bien connaître. Pour les connaître, il faut les aimer, et plus on les aime et davantage on les tue. C’est même pire que cela en vérité. C’est exactement dans la mesure où on les aime qu’on éprouve le besoin et la joie de les tuer. Et alors, qu’on ait faim ou non, que cela rapporte ou que cela coûte, avec ou sans licence, en terrain permis ou défendu, que l’animal soit dangereux ou sans défense, peu importe. S’il est beau, noble ou charmant, s’il vous touche au plus profond du cœur par sa puissance ou sa grâce, alors on tue, on tue… Pourquoi ? — Je ne sais pas, dis-je. Peut-être l’instant où vous allez l’abattre est-il le seul où vous pouvez sentir que la bête est vraiment à vous. — Peut-être »",janvier 2022,243,Livre,Fiction
Le Lion,Joseph Kessel,"Les Blancs n’ont pas le droit. Je ne veux pas qu’ils tuent les bêtes », dit Patricia. Sa voix était étouffée, haletante. « Les Noirs, c’est autre chose. C’est juste. Ils vivent avec les bêtes. Ils ressemblent aux bêtes. Ils n’ont pas plus d’armes que les bêtes. Mais les Blancs… Avec leurs gros fusils, leurs centaines de cartouches ! Et c’est pour rien. C’est pour s’amuser. Pour compter les cadavres.",janvier 2022,243,Livre,Fiction
Le Lion,Joseph Kessel,"Je restai seul pour m’imprégner de la nudité de cette demeure. Il était impossible d’en trouver une qui fût aussi démunie de ce qui sert à l’homme. Elle ne contenait rien. Ni l’âtre le plus primitif, ni le moindre objet, ni la plus humble besace, ni la natte la plus pauvre, ni le plus élémentaire ustensile pour préparer une nourriture ou la consommer. Rien.",janvier 2022,243,Livre,Fiction
Le Lion,Joseph Kessel,"Est-ce que Bullit, si dur envers ceux qui portaient la plus légère atteinte à la paix animale, partageait la conviction naïve de sa fille ? Pensait-il que la rigueur même et la vigilance par lesquelles il assurait cette paix méritaient qu’il pût la troubler quelquefois ? Ou, simplement, était-ce un goût, un instinct qu’il ne savait pas maîtriser ?",janvier 2022,243,Livre,Fiction
Le Lion,Joseph Kessel,"Mais l’aurore surgit d’un seul coup, prompte et glorieuse. La neige du Kilimandjaro devint un doux brasier. La brume se déchira en écharpes de fées, en poudre de diamant. L’eau étincela au fond de l’herbe. Les bêtes commencèrent à composer leur tapisserie vivante au pied de la grande montagne.",janvier 2022,243,Livre,Fiction
Le Lion,Joseph Kessel,"« Le pire, voyez-vous, poursuivit Sybil, c’est le moment où l’on n’est plus porté par la colère ou déchiré par la pitié. C’est quand on est tranquille ou lucide. Parce que là, on voit qu’il n’y a rien à faire. »",janvier 2022,243,Livre,Fiction
The Song of Achilles,Madeline Miller,He said what he meant; he was puzzled if you did not. Some people might have mistaken this for simplicity. But is it not a sort of genius to cut always to the heart?,janvier 2022,378,Livre,Historical Fiction

The Song of Achilles,Madeline Miller,"Odysseus inclines his head. “True. But fame is a strange thing. Some men gain glory after they die, while others fade. What is admired in one generation is abhorred in another.” He spread his broad hands. “We cannot say who will survive the holocaust of memory. Who knows?” He smiles. “Perhaps one day even I will be famous. Perhaps more famous than you.”",janvier 2022,378,Livre,Historical Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"Brailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory.

Atomic Habits,James Clear,"During the ten-year span from 2007 to 2017, British cyclists won 178 world championships and sixty-six Olympic or Paralympic gold medals and captured five Tour de France victories in what is widely regarded as the most successful run in cycling history.*",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem.",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"That said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. ",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"Stress compounds. The frustration of a traffic jam. The weight of parenting responsibilities. The worry of making ends meet. The strain of slightly high blood pressure. By themselves, these common causes of stress are manageable. But when they persist for years, little stresses compound into serious health issues. Negative thoughts compound. The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop. The same is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere. Outrage compounds. Riots, protests, and mass movements are rarely the result of a single event. Instead, a long series of microaggressions and daily aggravations ",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"Productivity compounds. Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day, but it counts for a lot over an entire career. The effect of automating an old task or mastering a new skill can be even greater. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas. Knowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won’t make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. As Warren Buffett says, “That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest.” Relationships compound. People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help others, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each ",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction

Atomic Habits,James Clear,"When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it.

Atomic Habits,James Clear,"Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people who don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom. Without good financial habits, you will always be struggling for the next dollar. Without good health habits, you will always seem to be short on energy. Without good learning habits, you will always feel like you’re behind the curve. If you’re always being forced to make decisions about simple tasks—when should I work out, where do I go to write, when do I pay the bills—then you have less time for freedom.

Atomic Habits,James Clear,"The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them. If you feel like you need extra help, then you can try Pointing-and-Calling in your own life. Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome will be. If you want to cut back on your junk food habit but notice yourself grabbing another cookie, say out loud, “I’m about to eat this cookie, but I don’t need it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health.”",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction

Atomic Habits,James Clear,"Once an implementation intention has been set, you don’t have to wait for inspiration to strike. Do I write a chapter today or not? Do I meditate this morning or at lunch?

Atomic Habits,James Clear,"When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking. Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit.",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"Habits like “read more” or “eat better” are worthy causes, but these goals do not provide instruction on how and when to act. Be specific and clear: After I close the door. After I brush my teeth. After I sit down at the table. The specificity is important. The more tightly bound your new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that you will notice when the time comes to act.",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.

Further analysis determined that the stickers cut bathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent per year.",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction

Atomic Habits,James Clear,"When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations. The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"Society is filled with highly engineered versions of reality that are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in. Stores feature mannequins with exaggerated hips and breasts to sell clothes. Social media delivers more “likes” and praise in a few minutes than we could ever get in the office or at home. Online porn splices together stimulating scenes at a rate that would be impossible to replicate in real life. Advertisements are created with a combination of ideal lighting, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits—even the model doesn’t look like the person in the final image. These are the supernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate features that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result, driving us into excessive shopping habits, social media habits, porn habits, eating habits, and many others.",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not after they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine when they see the powder, not after they take it. Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"Temptation bundling is one way to create a heightened version of any habit by connecting it with something you already want.

Atomic Habits,James Clear,"Your identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete. When you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identity becomes linked to those around you. Growth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. We are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s friendship and community that embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run.",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.

Atomic Habits,James Clear,"Pregame jitters. Many people feel anxious before delivering a big presentation or competing in an important event. They experience quicker breathing, a faster heart rate, heightened arousal. If we interpret these feelings negatively, then we feel threatened and tense up. If we interpret these feelings positively, then we can respond with fluidity and grace. You can reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.”",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle.

Atomic Habits,James Clear,"Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing. If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in.",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction

Atomic Habits,James Clear,"Japanese firms emphasized what came to be known as ‘lean production,’ relentlessly looking to remove waste of all kinds from the production process, down to redesigning workspaces, so workers didn’t have to waste time twisting and turning to reach their tools. The result was that Japanese factories were more efficient",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work. Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy. Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult. Prime your environment to make future actions easier.",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"People often think it’s weird to get hyped about reading one page or meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved. If you can’t learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer details. Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have to standardize before you can optimize.",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one. The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
Atomic Habits,James Clear,"Here’s the problem: most people know that delaying gratification is the wise approach. They want the benefits of good habits: to be healthy, productive, at peace. But these outcomes are seldom top-of-mind at the decisive moment. Thankfully, it’s possible to train yourself to delay gratification—but you need to work with the grain of human nature, not against it. The best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction

Atomic Habits,James Clear,"You don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If you start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain.

Atomic Habits,James Clear,"The inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it unsatisfying. We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying. An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us. A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.

Atomic Habits,James Clear,"However, the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each repetition develops fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback. You fall into mindless repetition. It becomes easier to let mistakes slide. When you can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you stop thinking about how to do it better.",octobre 2022,319,Livre,Non-Fiction
