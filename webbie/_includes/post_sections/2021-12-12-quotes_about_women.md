#### Quotes about Women and Men

Which stories thematizing women make it into an article? Are there recurring themes? 
What are topics about womenhood that society is wrangling with?
Can one deduce specific roles women tend to be put in?


Now we have an idea of what female and male speakers talk about when quoted in mainstream media. However, we are still missing a further important aspect of female presence in media: In what context are women or men mentioned. Looking at this notion of the quotes can give us a feeling of how women are viewed in society or rather what image of women (and men) is propagated by US mainstream media. Conversely, maybe there is a lot of fuss about nothing and indeed they are mentioned in very similar settings? To further elucidate this information in the quotes, we created new datasets from the  US mainstream media set, of quotes that mention words that are indicative of either gender like the words ‘man’, ‘boy’, ‘woman’, ‘lady’, ‘him’, ‘she’, etc. and categorized the quotes into either talking-about-men or talking about-woman quotes. 
We grouped both the quotes about men and women into seven different topics and again, while of course there is quite some overlap between the topics - such as general & lifestyle, family and politics, there are clearly topics reserved to the respective genders. While women appear second most frequently (after the less interpretable cluster termed “general life”) in the context of family & work, the most common topic cluster for men is service (to the country, military,...) paired with work. Surprisingly, for men the second most important cluster centers around family and almost exclusively so, which is contrary to the thematization jointly between work and family for women -  a topic we also know well as a typical societal problem of the family-work balance apparently only women face …

Furthermore, very stereotypically, sports is omnipresent as a “men’s topic” and appears for women only as a minor topic paired with culture and leisure connotation reflecting somewhat the importance of professional sports for male teams as opposed to the limited interest in female sport.

Quite expectedly - but still reassuring to see confirmed here - is the important topic of reproductive rights for women in the USA, which is, in all its specificity the 4th most dominating topic! That says quite a bit about what moves the USA of today…

What is generally observable is that although often the overarching topics are comparable, the connotation and pairing takes interesting twists and makes the devil lie in the detail. An additional example would be politics: For men, this is heavily paired with crime and violence, whereas for women it has a very heavy focus on elections and party politics.

##### Quotes about Women and Men in the context of Editor's Gender and Political Bias

From this analysis, we can still see that gender representation in media is still not ideally balanced in many aspects. So far, we have considered the content of the quotes only on the whole common US media outlets. But do these observations apply equally in journals of different political bias?
Although the general trend is not overwhelmingly different, there are a few oddities: We need to be careful due to the imbalance in first of all right-leaning vs. left-leaning media in the most frequented subset we present here. Looking back at the INTERACTIVE PLOT BY VLAD, you can see that within the right-leaning portion of media, there are no life-style magazines, such as Vanity Fair, Refinery29, etc. potentially covering different types of stories far away from political issues, so this may skew the data. Nevertheless, it is quite remarkable how politics and health & reproductive rights issues are heavily overrepresented in the right-leaning media compared to the overall and left-leaning dataset.

For men, one cannot observe such any big shift in topic distributions.
The gender of editors however, has so far no determinable influence on the story choice, hence the representation about men and women. Likely, other factors such as the type of magazine and the author have a higher impact, but this could not be determined in the course of this study.
